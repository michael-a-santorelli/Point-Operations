# pointOperations
This is a python module containing four digital image processing point operations. The four point operations are the following: brightness adjustment, image negative, contrast stretching, and piece-wise linear transformation.

The brightness adjustment function can be called as brightnessAdjust(...),
the image negative function can be called as imageNegative(...),
the contrast stretching function can be called as constrastStretching(...),
and the piece-wise linear transformation can be called as piecewiseTransform(...).
